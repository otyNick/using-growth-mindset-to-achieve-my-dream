  <h1>How a Growth Mindset Helped Me Achieve my Goal</h1>
  <p>Growth mindset can be paraphrased as <i>the view you adapt for yourself profoundly
    affects the way you lead your life</i>. Being gritty — persevering in the face of challenges
    and adversity- you are motivated to overcome those obstacles, whether in personal or professional
    life.</p>
  <p>Applying a growth mindset to achieving my goal has been a hard work.
     Much of it is also deeply uncomfortable and personal. Since learning
      takes hard work, the rule has always been trying again and again to
      achieve the best after which I do it best.</p>

<p>I believed intelligence and aptitude can be cultivated and improved,
  used the following techniques to unlock my potential:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Doing same thing differently:</b> After setting high goals, I try different ways of solving them until satisfied with the output.

</li><li><b>Setting a high standard:</b> I was always prepared for the worst but always expecting the best. Through this, I set goals that makes me uncomfortable to rest in my comfort zone.

</li><li><b>Seeking feedback and acting on it:</b> Would always ask people to criticize my work or actions. Based on the feedback I received, the next best action would follow.

</li><li><b>Noting my performance curve:</b> Through the notes taken, I would review my progress to check whether the graph is falling or increasing.

</li><li><b>Dealing with challenges:</b> This has been the most difficult part. Some challenges are demanding and not easy to meet. Accepting that challenges are part of the process has enabled me to scale through.

</li><li><b>Knowing my setbacks:</b> Knowing my weakness has helped me to tackle them since acknowledge is the first step in solving them
